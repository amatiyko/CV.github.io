                    <p>Experience in the trade field (2011 - 2016) (shop assistant, merchandiser, administrator, store manager); smart home systems sales manager (2016 - 2017).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Participated in development and set up an online store. The backend of the online store
                                          allows a user to manage cash registers, create cash reports, including tax
                            reports, analyze cash receipts; analyze sales statistics, etc.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Participated in implementation of the “Replenishment” project, which increased
                                          performance of a store. The project included setup of software, which
                            analyzes sales of a previous day, composes list of details for warehouse, which allows
                            easily finding and ordering relevant goods and to move them to shelves according to the
                            sales forecast. After implementation of the project, the sales have increased by 25-30%.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Participated in the development of the "smart home" engineering systems on-line
                            configurator.</p></li>
                        <li><p>3D images of products creating (locks, keys, etc.) using 3D SolidWorks.</p></li>

                            www.comfortliving.com.ua</p></li>
                        <li><p>Developed software (as a part of my graduation project), which simulates processes in the
                            voltage converter. The software provides necessary diagrams for the analysis of the
                            mathematical model
                            while counting different processes.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Being a shop administrator, analyzed trade outlets’ performance the Business
                                   Intelligence (BI)
system. The analysis included store performance results in comparison to previous and current years, determination of
                            a percentage of each department in the total turnover (mix), key performance indicators
                            (KPI) analysis, determination of the best product in each structure, inventory analysis (week cover).</p></li>
